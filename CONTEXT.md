## Scope

`gopartman` is a Go library. It manages PostgreSQL partitioned tables.
It has one bounded context. All terms below belong to that context.

## Glossary

### Parent

An ordinary PostgreSQL partitioned table. A parent has `PARTITION BY
RANGE (...)` on either a time column or a `(tenant, time)` composite.
The user creates the parent. `gopartman` does not create it.

- Registered with: `Registry.RegisterParent`.
- Not to be confused with: **Partition** (a child of the parent).

### Tenant

A value that groups rows of a parent. The library treats a tenant as an
opaque string. A tenant is required only when the parent has a
`TenantColumn`.

- Registered with: `Registry.RegisterTenant`.
- Not to be confused with: **Parent** (the tenant belongs to one
  parent).

### Partition

One child table of a parent. A partition has bounds. A partition can
also be the default partition.

- Not to be confused with: **Parent** (the parent has many partitions).

### Default Partition

The child table with `DEFAULT` bounds. It catches rows that no bounded
partition accepts. Every parent has exactly one default partition. The
library creates the default partition when the user registers the
parent.

- Not to be confused with: **Partition** (a bounded partition holds
  rows in a known range; the default holds the rest).

### Bounds

A half-open time range `[From, To)`. `From` is included. `To` is
excluded. Bounds match PostgreSQL range semantics. A day partition
runs `[00:00 UTC, next 00:00 UTC)`.

- Not to be confused with: closed `[From, To]` intervals. The library
  never uses closed intervals.

### Premake

The number of future partitions to keep ahead of the current period.
The default is 4. The value is stored on the parent row in
`partman.parent_tables.premake`.

- Not to be confused with: **Retention Window** (premake is ahead;
  retention is behind).

### Retention Window

The interval before which a partition is a drop candidate. The value
is stored on the parent row in `partman.parent_tables.retention_period`
as a PostgreSQL `INTERVAL`.

- Not to be confused with: **Premake** (premake is ahead; retention is
  behind).

### Detach

`ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION`. The child table becomes an
ordinary table. The rows stay. The table stays in the same schema
unless retention moves it.

- Not to be confused with: **Drop** (drop removes the table; detach
  keeps it).

### Drop

`DROP TABLE ... CASCADE`. The child table and its rows are gone. The
metadata row moves to `status = 'dropped'`.

- Not to be confused with: **Detach** (drop removes the table; detach
  keeps it).

### Archive Schema

A PostgreSQL schema where detached tables move for cold storage. The
schema is set per parent in
`partman.parent_tables.retention_schema`. The library does not create
the schema. The user must create it.

- Not to be confused with: **`partman` schema** (which holds metadata,
  not user data).

### Pre-Drop Hook

A Go function that runs before Retention drops, detaches, or archives
a partition. The hook returns `HookDrop`, `HookDetach`, `HookArchive`,
or `HookSkip`. The hook is global, not per-parent. The hook filters by
inspecting the `PartitionRef` it receives.

- Not to be confused with: **partition_data drain** (drain moves rows;
  the hook decides fate).

### Maintenance Run

One iteration of the maintenance loop. In one run, the Maintainer
iterates parents, holds the advisory lock per parent, calls Provisioner
and Retention, and releases the lock.

- Not to be confused with: **tick** (a tick is the ticker event; a
  maintenance run is the work triggered by the tick).

### Advisory Lock Key

The two-int32 pair used with `pg_try_advisory_lock`. The pair is
`(hashtext(schema), hashtext(table))`. The lock scope is per parent.

- Not to be confused with: **PostgreSQL row locks** (advisory locks are
  application-level; the library does not use row locks for
  maintenance).

### Reconcile

Bring metadata and PostgreSQL state in line. One operation reconciles
in one direction only.

- Provisioner: metadata drives PG. It creates missing tables.
- Importer: PG drives metadata. It inserts missing rows.
- Not to be confused with: **drift** (drift is the discrepancy;
  reconcile is the action).

### Anomaly

A condition that the library detects but cannot fix. Examples: a row
in the default partition that no bounded partition accepts; a metadata
row without a matching PG table (orphan).

- Not to be confused with: **error** (an error stops the operation; an
  anomaly is recorded and the operation continues).

### `partman` schema

The PostgreSQL schema that holds `gopartman` metadata: `parent_tables`,
`tenants`, `partitions`. The library never puts user data here.

- Not to be confused with: **user schema** (where user tables live).

### `partition_data` drain

A batch operation that moves rows out of the default partition and
into the correct bounded child partitions. It runs one transaction per
batch. It is safe to interrupt.

- Not to be confused with: **Detach** and **Drop** (drain moves rows;
  the retention sweep removes tables).

## Public API surface

Every exported name in the root `gopartman` package. One sentence per
name. Details of each concept live above in the glossary; this section
maps names to concepts.

### Facade and construction

- **`Manager`** — the facade. Composes Registry, Provisioner,
  Retention, Maintainer, Importer, and Drain. See `manager.go`.
- **`New(opts ...Option) (*Manager, error)`** — the only constructor.
  Requires `WithDB` and `WithClock`.
- **`Option`** — the functional-option type accepted by `New`.
- **`WithDB(*pgxpool.Pool)`** — supplies the pool. Required.
- **`WithClock(Clock)`** — supplies the clock. Required.
- **`WithLogger(*slog.Logger)`** — optional; defaults to
  `slog.Default()`.
- **`WithHook(Hook)`** — installs the global pre-drop hook.
- **`WithScheduleInterval(time.Duration)`** — sets the maintenance
  tick interval. Default is 1 hour.
- **`WithMeter(Meter)`** — installs the observability sink. Default
  is `NoopMeter{}`.

### Clock

- **`Clock`** — interface with one method, `Now() time.Time`.
- **`RealClock`** — wraps `time.Now`.
- **`NewRealClock()`** — constructor.
- **`SimulatedClock`** — concurrency-safe test clock with
  `SetTime` and `AdvanceTime`.
- **`NewSimulatedClock(t)`** — constructor.

### Parents and tenants

- **`ParentConfig`** — describes a parent for `RegisterParent`.
- **`ParentRef`** — identifies a registered parent by
  `(schema, table)`.
- **`ParentInfo`** — read-only view returned by `ListParents`.
- **`TenantConfig`** — describes a tenant for `RegisterTenant`.
- **`TenantRef`** — identifies a registered tenant.
- **`TenantInfo`** — read-only view returned by `ListTenants`.
- **`Tenant`** — small helper struct that carries a parent + tenant
  triple.
- **`RemoveOption`** — tunes `RemoveParent`.
- **`WithCascadeDrop`** — `RemoveOption` that drops child partitions
  during removal.

### Retention

- **`SweepReport`** — summary of one `Retention.Sweep` call.
- **`SweepOption`** — tunes one `Sweep`.
- **`WithDryRun`** — `SweepOption` that reports without emitting
  DDL.

### Hook API

- **`Hook`** — function type invoked before Retention drops,
  detaches, or archives a candidate. See **Pre-Drop Hook** above.
- **`HookDecision`** — the enum returned by `Hook`.
- **`HookDrop`**, **`HookDetach`**, **`HookArchive`**, **`HookSkip`**
  — the four decision constants.
- **`PartitionRef`** — the descriptor passed to `Hook`.

### Import and reconcile

- **`ReconcileReport`** — result of `ImportExisting`: `Imported`,
  `Drifted`, `Orphaned`, `Skipped`.
- **`DriftedPartition`** — a child whose name-implied bounds
  disagree with its actual PG bound.
- **`SkippedPartition`** — a child whose name does not match the
  library's grammar.

### Drain

- **`DrainReport`** — summary of one `PartitionData` call.
- **`DrainAnomaly`** — one condition drain could not fix
  (missing target, null control column).
- **`DrainOption`** — tunes one `PartitionData`.
- **`WithBatchSize`**, **`WithMaxBatches`**, **`WithTenant`** — the
  three drain options.

### Observability

- **`Meter`** — sink for counters and histograms. Never receives
  `tenant_id` as a tag (see ADR-0010).
- **`NoopMeter`** — default `Meter`; records nothing.

### Migrations

- **`Migration`** — one embedded SQL file: `Version`, `Name`, `SQL`.
- **`Migrations()`** — returns the embedded migrations in ascending
  version order.

### Naming

- **`TableName`** — the partition-name grammar. `Build` renders,
  `Parse` inverts.
- **`Bounds`** — half-open time range `[From, To)`.
- **`PartitionHourInterval`**, **`PartitionDayInterval`**,
  **`PartitionWeekInterval`**, **`PartitionMonthInterval`** —
  the four supported interval sentinels.
- **`PartitionIntervalLabel`** — maps an interval sentinel to its
  canonical `partman.parent_tables.partition_interval` label.
- **`DateNoHyphens`** — the `YYYYMMDD` layout used in bounded
  partition suffixes.

## Non-goals for v1

These terms appear in pg_partman but NOT in `gopartman` v1:

- **List partitioning**, **Hash partitioning**
- **Sub-partitioning**, **Template Table**
- **Epoch** (integer-time columns)
- **Constraint Cols**, **Optimize Constraint**
- **undo_partition** (merge child tables back into one)
- **jobmon** (pg_jobmon integration)

If a future PR needs any of these, open an ADR first.
